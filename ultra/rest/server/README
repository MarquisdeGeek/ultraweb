With the users example we can modify and query the users table
with the following endpoints.

Remember to configure a database, as mentioned in config.php

Note: There is no API authentication in this sample.

Create a new user:
  users.php?new=1&name=Steev

List all users:
  users.php?list

Review a single user, given their token ID:
  users.php?id={token}


The results are all on JSON.


Note: This was written for Migraine Alert, and still suffers some 
of its hangovers. Notable, all data is expected to be associated
to a machine_token. The machine_token and all records have an
'is owned by' relationship. You can ignore it in most cases; it's 
more important to introduce authentication to the API!
